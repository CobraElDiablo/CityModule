README : CITY MODULE FOR AURORA (0.2Dev)

	City generation module based on specified parameters. This modules intention is to be able
	to generate a city, including waterways, roads, rail, and buildings over a single region or
	to even create the regions as needed for import of pre generated cities, or even game cities.

CURRENT:	0.0.0.10

	Module load and is recognised by Aurora, simple command console interface framework.
	Some internal functionality for response to commands (does not perform any actions,
	apart from the city generate command, note it WILL cause an exception, non Aurora fatal).

TODO:

	Create a ini configuration file for City Builder and move it's options from AuroraModules.ini
	Dynamic construction of regions within a server instance.
	Expand framework for future features.
	Upgrade the internal methods with lots more functionality.
	Primitive creation and manipulation via City Builder.
	Add scripts and events to the city as a whole and for individual things, like buildings,
	cars etc Add import and export features for generated cities along with game cities 
	(forex Liberty City).

FUTURE:

	Paint the sky blue with pink dots, erm anything is a potential possibility, remote admin
	for the module perhaps, transfer of buildings, land etc through any 'currency' services 
	available. To be able to simulate the growth and development of the city, altough this 
	will only happen when a currency system has been added to Aurora to allow for an AI driven 
	marketplace economy for the city to be used, with potential for linking to other cities 
	for 'trade'. Provide a 'job' market that users can take and be paid in world currency for,
	although this role will probably be taken by the bots that Aurora has with some extra 
	behaviour added to them.
